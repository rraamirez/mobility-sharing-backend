This Final Degree Project aims to develop a mobile application that promotes sustainable mobility in urban environments by creating a social network for ride-sharing. The application will enable users to connect with others who take similar routes, optimizing their journeys and reducing environmental impact.

The key features of the project include:

Route and Schedule Registration:
Users will be able to specify the urban routes they frequently travel, including details such as origin, destination, days, and times. This will allow other users to view available routes and join them according to their needs.

Route Posting and Joining:
Users will have the option to publish their daily routes or join those shared by others, creating a collaborative travel network. This feature facilitates the efficient and real-time organization of shared journeys.

Reputation System:
The application will include a rating and feedback system, allowing users to evaluate their experience and that of others. This will foster trust and transparency within the community.

Virtual Currency (Rupees):
As an incentive, users offering rides will earn a virtual currency called Rupees. This currency can be used to join other trips, encouraging exchange and collaboration.

Virtual Currency Usage:
Users who wish to join a shared ride can do so using the Rupees they have earned, creating a circular economy within the platform.

This project seeks to promote a sustainable alternative for urban mobility, encouraging ride-sharing and strengthening community ties through an interactive, collaborative social network. The inclusion of a reputation system and virtual economy will provide a reliable and dynamic environment for users.
